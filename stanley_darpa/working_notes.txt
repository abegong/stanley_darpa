===== Done =====
* On the ticker page, highlight cities depending on how many teams have found them
* alphabetize the cities...they seem like they might be in population order?
* Cities: if you want to highlight them based on the number who have found them, I suggest either doing a number in parenthesis (easiest) or some gradation (this may be hard to discern on a phone, but there are only 6 teams, so it wouldn't be too hard, maybe?)
* On the ticker page, make the countdown timer actually count down
* On the ticker page, add scores to team rankings
* Add a "Cities" page that will list individual cities and which teams have found them.
* Prettify cities page

=== Next steps ===
* Build teamDetails page
* prettify teamDetails page
* Sort team scores on ticker page
* Animate team scores on ticker page
* Animate cities on ticker page



===== Essential =====
* Add a "Team" page that will give details about individual teams to help with strategizing and counter-strategizing

===== Optional =====


Ideas
* On the ticker page, change and animate rankings, scores, and cities light as new events come in

* Clean up the "submit" page -- Is this the way we want it to work?  It feels slow to me. Are there fields we can drop?

2. If you click the team names, it would be nice if you could see all the posts each team has done (this might come with the points updating). If I immediately check the ticker, I can see my picture that I just posted (for about 30 seconds or so) but  I'm not sure that the ticker would cycle back through again for me to catch my upload if I am a little slow to click over.
