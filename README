Stanley-Darpa is a game/social experiment was originally designed as an exercise for an undergraduate class in systems thinking at the University of Michigan.


Much-needed improvements:
* Add admin pages to set up teams, instructions, and scoring systems, and approve/reject submitted photos.
* Change client-side pages to properly manage the game state.
* Block submissions after the deadline.
* A good deep-cleaning. There are lots of sloppy sections of this code.

Things I'd love to get around to:
* Add a world map to track submissions by IP address.
* Add a mobile version.
